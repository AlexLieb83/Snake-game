<strong>How It's Made:</strong>
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a web app to play the classic game snake in your browser. This was my introduction to using the keyboard to control the pixels moving across the screen. 

<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>

Building this site was my first time building a game. This was a lot of fun to learn, making the snake move across the screen, grow when food is eaten, 
and keep up with the length the snake traveled.
